# monkey

## Introduction

Monkey is a framework for building "RESTful" JSON-over-HTTP APIs, based on the
notion of a *resource*. This approach allows us to automatically inject HATEOAS
metadata into responses, and to define our API as a tree of resources (rather
than a list of handlers).

## Installing

The usual: `cabal install monkey`.

## Usage

Example should be added here; in the meantime, I'm afraid it's down to RTFS.
